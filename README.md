# CCV RSE(Web) Assigment

Thank you for taking the time to complete this programming assignment. Through this exercise, we seek to get an insight into:
* your technical skills
* approach to problem solving
* software development practices

Members of our group come from very diverse backgrounds. We understand that methodologies vary greatly depending on your background. While we provide some guidance on technology and approach, you are welcome to use the approach and technology that you are most comfortable with and gives you a fair opportunity to complete the assignment and show us your best work.

If completing this assignment would be an undue burden, please reach out and we will work with you to find another way to assess your technical experience.

## Tasks to be completed

The main objective is to develop a Front End Web Application that provides a summary or visualization that helps CCV determine which of its public repositories in the [brown-ccv GitHub organization](https://github.com/brown-ccv) could/should be archived. The choice of technologies, metrics and visualizations are design choices that we are pourposely leaving up to you. However, feel free to reach out if you have questions. Below are some things we like, which may help you guide your choices:

* We are fans of modern Web frameworks such as React and Vue
* We are fans of live queries to the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
  * The [ropositories endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos) may be useful
* We are fans of well formatted code, comments, types, modularity
* We are fans of interactive visualizations
* We are fans of a good README.md
* We are fans of conventional commits

## Deliverables
* Source code. We will share a starter repository containing this README with you. Please commit all code (no build files please!) to this repo.
* Updated README.md with explanations about how to run your code and an overview of the application and any major design decisions you made.
* Demonstration of working application. Here you have choices.
   * (Required) Short recording of a walkthrough of the features of your working application, you can optionally describe key parts of your code as well
   * (Very Optional) Deployment to the web (e.g. Netlify, Heroku, GH Pages)

Please try your best. We'll evaluate whatever you provide us, even if your solution is incomplete.

## Time to completion
You have one week to complete the assignment.

## After completion
You will hear from us regarding next steps within 15 days. Continuing candidates will be invited for a presentation.
